In three steps (define astory graph, prepare media items and configure the XIMPELplaylist and application) users are guided in creating theirproductions. By providing thematical constraints users arechallenged to find a personal approach towards the creationof their production, using storytelling and/or gameplay as apractical means to apply a theme into their work. Whencomparing XIMPEL to (commercial) game engines for usagewithin education, the biggest strengths of XIMPEL are therelative ease of use and fast prototyping capabilities, whilemaintaining rich interaction possibilities. Guided by ongoingtechnological advances, a HTML5 based version of XIMPELis in active development, with the intention of making theframework even more accessible for both desktop and mobileplatforms along with more users, targeting increasinglyeducational applications as developed for our courses inserious games.",

abstract="Like many gambling games, the exceedingly popular and lucrative smartphone game ``Candy Crush'' features near-miss outcomes. In slot machines, a near-miss involves getting two of the needed three high-paying symbols on the pay-line (i.e., just missing the big win). In Candy Crush, the game signals when you just miss getting to the next level by one or two moves. Because near-misses in gambling games have consistently been shown to invigorate play despite being frustrating outcomes, the goal of the present study was to examine whether such near-misses trigger increases in player arousal, frustration and urge to continue play in Candy Crush. Sixty avid Candy Crush players were recruited to play the game for 30Â min while having their Heart Rate, Skin Conductance Level, subjective arousal, frustration and urge to play recorded for three types of outcomes: wins (where they level up), losses (where they don't come close to levelling up), and near-misses (where they just miss levelling up). Near-misses were more arousing than losses as indexed by increased heart rate and greater subjective arousal. Near-misses were also subjectively rated as the most frustrating of all outcomes. Most importantly, of any type of outcome, near-misses triggered the most substantial urge to continue play. These findings suggest that near-misses in Candy Crush play a role in player commitment to the game, and may contribute to players playing longer than intended.",

abstract="Older adults traditionally face major challenges at work when it comes to dealing with new technological tools. A sense of overwhelm and frustration can quickly arise under these circumstances. Continuous negative feelings in the work environment may lead to the increase of the risks for cognitive decline and threaten independence and quality of life. In this work, we focus on the seamless identification of frustration of older adults at work via physiological sensors embedded in an in-house developed computer mouse, denoted as CogniMouse. For the purpose of this research, we have developed a probabilistic classification algorithm that receives real-time signals and physiological measurement streams as input, and accordingly identifies frustration events. Ultimately, such classification can be leveraged to deliver user interventions and personalized solutions to help reduce user frustration.",
