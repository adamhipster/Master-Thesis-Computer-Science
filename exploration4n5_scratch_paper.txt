TIME SCRUBBING

Within Subject difficulties
... Parallel player difficulties
... Users having choice difficulties

Between subject difficulties
... Between subject difficulties
... interaction within & between subject difficulties

I need to reread the chapter and structure this better


NEW TIME SCRUBBING STRUCTURE OF CHAPTER
1. Presenting future overlays in a single media item
2. Within subject time scrubbing
3. Between subject time scrubbing
4. Interaction within and between subject time scrubbing

Subjects
... within
... between
... interaction

Overlays
... per media item
... within subjects   (did not do this)
... between subjects  (did not do this)

MERGING THE TWO (holy shit this looks a lot like Knowledge and Media, taxonomy forcing a certain type of look or knowledge on the world, do I still have those reflections?)
Subjects
... within
    +++ per media item overlay
    +++ within subjects overlay
... between
    +++ between subjects overlay
... interaction
