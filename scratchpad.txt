% Biggest critique of the review is no user evaluation

% In their study the users had to perform known-item search tasks in videos of about one
% hour duration by using a simple HTML5 video player. The results of their study show
% that users mainly use forward navigation with the seeker-bar (in 48% of the time) but
% also simple playback (36%) in order to look for desired content in videos. They, however,
% rarely use reverse navigation (only in 17% of the time). The analysis of the navigation
% logs clearly shows that most users prefer to search linearly from the beginning to the
% end and restart from the beginning if the search was not successful.

% Hypervideo 360ยบ
% Many of
% these tools try to follow metaphors from real life, such as film strips, multiple parallel
% displays, and simulated tape recorders. Many interfaces make use of the third dimension
% and visualize content in structures like a 3D helix or a 3D ring. A 3D cube was
% especially interesting as it utilizes 3D to summarize the motion of a video through
% voxel-based visualization. It is also observable that many tools try to make navigation
% in videos more convenient by using concepts like elastic navigation sliders with rubberband
% effects, direct manipulation of objects, and synchronized display of thumbnails.
% A few authors also focus on improved navigation of streamed videos, which seems to
% be very important since usage of video streaming is growing quickly

% The analysis of the navigation
% logs clearly shows that most users prefer to search linearly from the beginning to the
% end and restart from the beginning if the search was not successful.

% However, less attention has been paid on evaluating user behavior and designing
% user interfaces to better support the discovered behavior. Future works on video navigation
% should consider such findings when designing improved video interaction methods.
% Similarly, more studies should be performed on other video interaction methods
% in order to elicit real user needs (cf. [Worring et al. 2012]).

% Do you have multiple YouTube videos that you can manipulate individually? Or should it be at the level of a subject?
