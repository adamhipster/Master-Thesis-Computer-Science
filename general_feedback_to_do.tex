Dude, gooi dit gewoon in een email. Het is niet *super belangrijk*

TO DO in history of hypermedia (when everything else is finished)
% Explain how XIMPEL works -- isn't it explained already somewhere?
% Search for extra literature regarding hypermedia now
% Talk about companies that do hypermedia

FUTURE WORK / DISCUSSION
% ximpel as annotation tool
% Online platform to create and distribute XIMPEL apps
% How does XIMPEL relate to rhetoric and procedural rhetoric? -- future work

--- ---

SUPPORT WEBSITE (and during feedback perhaps :D )
% Misschien een XIMPEL style guide maken? -- evt. in template zetten, bijv. scene skipping via overlays
% Create your own showcase

DURING FEEDBACK
% Implement ximpel branches in React
% ximpel and css
% Think about preface and afterword
% Also: put Moewe (of tex stack exchange) in the acknowledgements
% Read DSL literature and incorporate it
% Also one of the outcomes of this thesis should be: clear formulated research questions and an answer to how much has been done
